# job-ready-pages
Web page templates created as part of the fantastic [Get Job Ready](https://github.com/P1xt/p1xt-guides/blob/master/deprecated/job-ready-javascript-edition-3.0.md) checklist. Each page is associated with a project on the list and follows the theme requirement. (Landing page, personal page, portfolio page, etc).
